### General Workflow 

Two main entities : ***Flash Loan Providers*** & ***Users***.

To interact with Flash Loan Providers, Users required to develop a smart contract. A userâ€™s contract usually includes three parts: 
1) borrowing the loan(s) from Flash Loan providers, 
2) interacting with other smart contracts, and 
3) returning the loan(s).

Let's break down Flash Loan transaction into 5 steps:
1. *Flash Loan Providers* transfers requested assets to the *Users*.
2. Invoke *Users's* pre-designed operations.
3. Users will use borrowed assets to execute other operations.
4. After completion of execution, *Users* hae to returns the borrowed amount with or withour the extra fee carged by providers.
5. *Flash Loan Providers* will check their balance and in case of insufficient funds return they can revert the whole transaction.
